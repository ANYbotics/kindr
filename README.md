## Changelog

### Kindr 1.0.0

* Simplified header include `#include <kindr/Core>` is provided.
* Kindr is now strongly dependent on Eigen.
* All sub namespaces have been removed. (e.g. `kindr::rotations::eigen_impl` -> `kindr::`)
* The implementations of rotations and time derivatives have been simplified (Passive, Hamiltonian).
    - Active typedefs (e.g. RotationQuaternionAD) have been removed and simpler ones (e.g. RotationQuaternionD) have been introduced.
    - Note that the functionality of some operators changed! Please check the [cheat sheet](https://opensource.docs.anymal.com/doxygen/kindr/master/cheatsheet_latest.pdf) to understand what is implemented.
    - Some hints on what needs to be changed from kindr 0.0.1:
       - `rotation.setFromVectors(v1, v2)` -> `rotation.setFromVectors(v2, v1)`
       - `C_BI.boxPlus(dt * B_w_IB)` -> `C_BI.boxPlus(dt * C_IB * B_w_IB)`
       - `C_BI.boxMinus(dt *  B_w_IB)` ->  `-C_BI.boxMinus(dt * B_w_IB)`
       - Euler angles probably have to be negated.
* Conversion methods between ROS and kindr have been moved to the package [kindr_ros](https://github.com/anybotics/kindr_ros).
* Concatenation of Homogeneous Transformation is now implemented.
* Short typedefs are provided for Homogeneous Transformation: `HomTransformQuatD`, `HomTransformMatrixD`.
* Jacobian of exponential map is implemented.
* Unit tests based on gtest are provided to test the convention of other software packages.
    - Gazebo (gazebo::math::Quaternion) uses the same convention as kindr.
    - ROS TF (tf::Quaternion and tf::Matrix3x3) uses the same convention as kindr.
    - RBDL's RigidBodyDynamics::Math::SpatialTransform uses the same convention as kindr, whereas RBDL's RigidBodyDynamics::Math::Quaternion concatenates differently and its conversion to a rotation matrix is inverted.


## Requirements

* [Eigen 3.2.0](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (Older versions might also work)
* GCC 4.7 is required at the minimum.
* CMake 2.8.3 is required at the minimum.

## Building

### Building with cmake

Install the library with [CMake](www.cmake.org):

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_CMAKE=true
sudo make install
```

Note that `USE_CMAKE` defaults to `true` if catkin is not installed.

Uninstall the library with:

```bash
cd build
sudo make uninstall
```

Kindr can be included in your cmake project.
Add the following to your *CmakeLists.txt*:

```
find_package(kindr)
include_directories(${kindr_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

### Building with catkin

Build kindr with [catkin](wiki.ros.org/catkin):

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:anybotics/kindr.git
catkin_make_isolated -C ~/catkin_ws
```

or with [catkin command line tools](http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.org):

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:anybotics/kindr.git
catkin build -w ~/catkin_ws kindr
```

Kindr can be included in your catkin project with:
Add the following to your *CMakeLists.txt*:
```
find_package(catkin COMPONENTS kindr)
include_directories(${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

And to your *package.xml*:

```xml
<package>
  <build_depend>kindr</build_depend>
</package>
```


### Building the documentation

Build the documentation with [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org):
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make kindr_doc
```

The doxygen documentation can be found here:

```
build/doc/html/index.html
```

### Building unit tests with gtest

[GTests](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) are only built if the folder *gtest* exists in the root folder.

Download and use GTest:

```bash
wget https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/release-1.7.0.zip
unzip release-1.7.0.zip
ln -s googletest-release-1.7.0 gtest
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DUSE_CMAKE=true -DBUILD_TEST=true
make
```

Note that `USE_CMAKE` defaults to `true` if catkin is not installed.
